# Exercise-5

The final grade of a computer science student is calculated based on the grades of four
aspects of their academic performance: participation, first midterm exam, second midterm
exam and final exam. Knowing that previous grades enter the final grade with avarages of
10%, 25, 25% and 40%, make a program that calculates and prints the final grade obtained
by a student.
